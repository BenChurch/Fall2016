The content of this zipped folder is organized as follows:

	ProjectDescription.docx contains: 
		- One page description of solution approach...
		- Appendix 1 - Data Pipeline; illustrates and explains data processing, from raw data to network performance
		- Appendix 2 - Results; Graphs of numerous MATLAB network training trials showing MSEs. Data used to compute 
					averages shown in graphs is in ./NetworkPerformance.xlsx.

	NetworkPerformance.xlsx contains:
		- MATLAB network configuration parameters
		- Training, validation, and testing mean-squared-errors for network training trials
		- Statistics calculated from MSE data
		- Graphs of statistics

	ScoliosisNeurallNets contains:
		- A 3D Slicer (https://www.slicer.org/) extension I wrote; the extension has 3 modules:
			~ CenterAndNormalizeLandmarks - This centers my geometric points by subtracting average values, and normalizes them by dividing by max values
			~ DegradeTransverseProcsses - This simulates ultrasound error in these geometric points. It also extracts ground truth angles from the original point sets.
			~ ExtendSpine - This is used to extrapolate all my point sets of variable lenght to be the same length, so my network can have constant architecutre.
					ExtendSpine also splices together the completed sets with degraded sets. Upon normalization, that will serve as input to the network. 
		- This extension is probably a lot of code to look through, and it uses tags to recognize different types of data sets
		- If you want to see it working, and aren't familiar wwith Slicer, email me (0bc15@queensu.ca), and I can meet with you and demonstrate.

	CurvatureEstimationNetwork contains:
		- A Visual Studio solution. This program contains:
			~ The current state of development (non-functional) of a neural network framework I am working on to
			extend my results beyond MATLAB's neural network function fitting app.
			~ Code to read the .csv files generated by the Slicer extension componenet of the data processing pipeline, and write that data to files suitable for use with MATLAB.
				+ The input for this is placed in the program directory as 'Input.csv' a contiguous file of all point set names with their true curvatures, and the coordinates
				of all points in those sets.
				+ It produces 'AllCoords_0.txt', and 'AllAngles_0.txt', which contain the MATLAB input and target data respectively.

	MyNeuralNetworkFunction.m contains the neural network generated by MATLAB for one of the trials.

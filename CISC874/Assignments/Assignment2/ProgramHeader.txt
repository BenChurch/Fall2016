/*	CISC 874 Assignment #2, by Ben Church - 10006197

This program reads both training and test data into class structures convienient for then training and testing a neural network
described in "Assignment2ProgramDescription.docx", and defined below.

Training epochs are repeated until a limit is exceeded. Each training epoch constitutes bringing the netork into equilibrium with
a new input image, and then backpropagating error information to correct the weight values for that image. Mean-squarred-error is
tracked throughout training so that if perormance is not improving, the network is restored to the best known configuration. The
a random image is then used to perturb the network's weights in an unpredictable way, and training is resumed.

After training, the network is tested. Testing means iterating through each image in the test data, and comparing the network's
classification to the provided classifications. The number of correct classifications is tracked so a classification accuracy
for the test data can be computed. The network writes its classifications, with the correct ones, to 'output.txt'.

Initial random weights for setosa versus non-setosa classification: -0.530000	-0.730000	-0.220000	0.430000	0.860000	 (where w0 is the threshold)
Initial random weights for versicolour versus virginia classification: -0.690000	-0.290000	0.920000	-0.210000	0.270000	 (where w0 is the threshold)
Training epochs required to correctly classify all setosas versus non-setosas: 0
Normalized weight vector which classifies setosas versus non-setosas: 	-0.396506	-0.546131	-0.164588	0.321694	0.643388
Therefore the perceptron correctly distinguished 0 samples out of 0 as being Iris-setosa or not.

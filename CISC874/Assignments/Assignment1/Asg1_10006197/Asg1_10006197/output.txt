Initial random weights for setosa versus non-setosa classification: -0.090000	0.770000	-0.730000	-1.000000	0.290000	 (where w0 is the threshold)
Initial random weights for versicolor versus virginica classification: 0.070000	-0.930000	-0.860000	-0.930000	-0.210000	 (where w0 is the threshold)
Training epochs required to correctly classify all setosas versus non-setosas: 0
Normalized weight vector which classifies setosas versus non-setosas: 	-0.060431	0.517023	-0.490165	-0.671459	0.194723
Therefore the perceptron correctly distinguished 0 samples out of 0 as being Iris-setosa or not.

Training epochs required to correctly classify all setosas versus non-setosas: 0
Normalized weight vector which classifies setosas versus non-setosas: 	-0.090000	-0.470000	-0.330000	-0.590000	0.770000
Therefore the perceptron correctly distinguished 0 samples out of 0 as being Iris-setosa or not.
Therefore the perceptron correctly distinguished 0 samples out of 0 as being Iris-setosa or not.

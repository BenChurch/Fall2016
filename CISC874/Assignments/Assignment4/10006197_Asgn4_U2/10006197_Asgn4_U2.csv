Title,Threshold activation function disadvantages,,,
QuestionText,What are the disadvantages to using a threshold function for a node's activation function discussed in class?,,,
Points,1,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Answer,100,"Derivative is not continuously defined, certain arbitrarily small changes in input produce large changes in output, cannot produce continuously variable output",regexp,
Answer,66,"Any two of: Derivative is not continuously defined, certain arbitrarily small changes in input produce large changes in output, cannot produce continuously variable output",,
Answer,33,"Any one of: Derivative is not continuously defined, certain arbitrarily small changes in input produce large changes in output, cannot produce continuously variable output",,
Feedback,"Despite being an easily understood model of neuron behaviour, the threshold activation function imposes certain limitations on functionality and analysis, such as those mentioned here. You can probably think of other valid disadvantages to its use.",,,

Title,Volume calculation in 3D input space,,,
QuestionText,What is the size of the volume of input space which corresponds to the activation of this neural network?,,,
Points,1,,,

Option,0,2,,That is incorrect
Option,0,4,,That is incorrect
Option,100,6,,Correct!
Option,0,8,,That is incorrect
Hint," Note that with 3 input variables, input nodes produce planes rather than lines. It may help to draw the input space.",,,
Feedback,"Such a volume can be found by converting the inputs, combined with their weights, into inequalities. The inequalities can be rearranged to find ranges for each input variable which activate the network. These ranges are bounded by planes which, when combined, partition a volume in input space.",,,

Title,Hidden layer weight updates,,,
QuestionText,Why are changes in hidden layer weights proportional to output layer weights?,,,
Points,1,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Answer,100,"Because the error contribution to the output, from a given hidden node is proportional to the weight connection the hidden node to the output node.",regexp,
Answer,66,Something like: Because the ouput error is proportional to that weight - not mentioning the contribution of the hidden node through that weight,,
Answer,33,Something like: That reduces the output's error,,
Feedback,"This is meant to assess familiarity with backpropagation. To reduce error at the output, weights must be adjusted in such a way that the error decreases. That means representing the effects of the hidden nodes, which depened on their connection weights to the output.",,,

Title,Generalization insurance,,,
QuestionText,What is one way to mitigate the problem of a network failing to generalize?,,,
Points,1,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,0,Increase the number of hidden nodes,,That is incorrect
Option,100,Add random noise to the input data,,Correct!
Option,0,Decrease the learning rate,,That is incorrect
Option,0,Increase the training time,,That is incorrect
Hint,,,,
Feedback,"Adding random noise can help ensure a network maintains generality. The noise corresponds to the network being presented unfamiliar inputs, corresponding to known classes. It are these unfamiliar inputs which can be excluded from classifiability by the network 'over-learning', as a result of excessive training or too many hidden nodes.",,,

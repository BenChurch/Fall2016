  title    = {Spinal Curvature Measurement by Tracked Ultrasound Snapshots},
  year     = {2014},
  abstract = {Monitoring spinal curvature in adolescent kyphoscoliosis requires regular radiographic examina-
tions; however, the applied ionizing radiation increases the risk of cancer. Ultrasound imaging is favored over
radiography because it does not emit ionizing radiation. Therefore, we tested an ultrasound system for spinal cur-
vature measurement, with the help of spatial tracking of the ultrasound transducer. Tracked ultrasound was used
to localize vertebral transverse processes as landmarks along the spine to measure curvature angles. The method
was tested in two scoliotic spine models by localizing the same landmarks using both ultrasound and radiographic
imaging and comparing the angles obtained. A close correlation was found between tracked ultrasound and
radiographic curvaturemeasurements. Differences between results of the twomethods were 1.27 ± 0.84 (average
± SD) in an adult model and 0.96 ± 0.87 in a pediatric model. Our results suggest that tracked ultrasound may
become a more tolerable and more accessible alternative to radiographic spine monitoring in adolescent kypho-
scoliosis. (E-mail: ungi@cs.queensu.ca)  2014 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.},

  abstract  = {One conventional tool for interpolating surfaces over scat-
tered data, the thin-plate spline, has an  elegant algebra expressing the 
dependence of the physical bending energy of a  thin metal plate on  
point constraints. For interpolation of a  surface over a  fixed set of nodes 
in the plane, the bending energy is a  quadratic form in the heights 
assigned to the surface. The spline is the superposit ion of eigenvectors 
of the bending energy matrix, of successively larger physical scales, 
over a  tilted flat p lane having no  bending energy at all.},

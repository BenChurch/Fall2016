We have developed a method to create 3D visualization of the scoliotic spine, based on the locations of transverse processes as skeletal landmarks, by computationally warping an average healthy spine model to match the landmarks. We have shown that the method produces an excellent qualitative visual representation of the spine that is appropriate for inspection of the extent and nature of the curvature. Besides scoliosis evaluation, applications of this method may include automatic structure labelling, or the initial alignment for registration in surgical navigation.
